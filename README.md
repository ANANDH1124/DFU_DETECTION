# DFU_DETECTION
This Diabetic Foot Ulcer Detection project contains code for a Deep Learning-based classifier that predicts whether an input image shows an abnormal ulcer (dfu) or normal healthy skin. The classifier is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the web application interface is created using Streamlit.

# INTRODUCTION 
Diabetic Foot Ulcers (dfu) are a common complication of diabetes, and early detection plays a crucial role in effective management and prevention of complications. This project aims to provide a tool for healthcare professionals to quickly and accurately classify images of foot ulcers as either abnormal (dfu) or normal healthy skin using Deep Learning techniques.

# FEATURES
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture implemented in TensorFlow and Keras to classify dfu images.
Web Application Interface: Offers an intuitive web interface powered by Streamlit for users to upload images and receive instant predictions.
User-friendly: Simple and easy-to-use interface suitable for both healthcare professionals and non-technical users.
